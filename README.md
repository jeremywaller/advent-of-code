## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an advent calendar. Each day, a new two-part programming puzzle is released. These puzzles can be solved in any programming language and provide an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills and learn new programming concepts.
